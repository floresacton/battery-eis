chest holds 31 cells in volume
do 15s2p
makes IR = .01425
vnom = 54
simulation shows drop from 54 to 51.8v
15s1p drops to 49.4v
very acceptable

problems with pouch cell battery design:
tab connections
	hard to solder to
	hard to reach
	dangerous because of proximity
battery swelling
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vRjo0gaG1g
	battery will swell with cycles, heat, and SOC
	need to account for expansion of cells
	need to maintain pressure on cells internally
		often use foam pad to allow for expansion and constant pressure
		unsure how much force they can actually produce
